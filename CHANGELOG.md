# Changelog

All notable changes to palinex are documented here. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project adheres to [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] — 2026-05-22

Initial release.

### Added
- `palinex` Python package — typed builders for a2ui v0.9 surfaces with structural validation and optional jsonschema deep validation
- `index.html` — single-file lit-html renderer covering 14 of 18 a2ui Basic Catalog components (Text, Image, Icon, Row, Column, List, Card, Modal, Divider, Button, TextField, CheckBox, ChoicePicker, Slider)
- `host-bridge.html` — reference wrapper implementing the `a2ui.request` / `a2ui.response` postMessage protocol for host-to-renderer bridging
- v0.9 message envelope support (createSurface, updateComponents, updateDataModel, deleteSurface) and the convenience flat-shape payload form
- Data model with JSON-pointer (`DataBinding`) resolution and template `ChildList` rendering
- Markdown sidecar emission (lossless round-trip from surface to markdown)

### Known limitations
- Deep jsonschema validation through the catalog `$ref` chain is flaky due to upstream schema referencing patterns (documented in `palinex.Surface.validate`). Structural validation is reliable.
- Four Basic Catalog components not yet implemented: Tabs, DateTimeInput, Video, AudioPlayer.
- No accessibility (ARIA) pass-through yet — schema fields are parsed but not rendered to DOM.
